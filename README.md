What the app should do:

- Display a loading component. :white_check_mark:
- Fetch data from the provided api. :white_check_mark:
- Apply infinite scrolling. :white_check_mark:
- Display fetched data in a scrollable view that lazy loads more data when scrolled down. :white_check_mark:
- Display loading component at the bottom of the list on every lazy load. :white_check_mark:
- Show message when no more data fetched. :white_check_mark:
- Integrate basic search feature. :white_check_mark:

Sorry for I didn't use the environment that provided, I try to use it but most of the dependencies are deprecated so I use Vite React

for CSS I use TailwindCSS and I for fetch I use axios other libraries.

for image most of the images not working anymore so I add onError that it loads the image in the public folder instead.
